TLDR: What’s under the hood? This book uses files written in either in Markdown or R Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For now, you have to install the development versions of bookdown from Github: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. "],

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. 1.3 Figures and tables Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. p &lt;- ggplot(dnica, aes(x = age, fill = sex)) + geom_histogram(position = &quot;dodge&quot;, alpha = 0.6) + ggtitle(&quot;Historical Mortality Data&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Recorded Age at Death&quot;) p Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! # par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 3) Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2017) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],
